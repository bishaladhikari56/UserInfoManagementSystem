<h2>Description about the project</h2>
<p>This is a project done using spring boot, mysql,jsp and  hibernate. We create a user and do the basic
    crud application like add, save, delete, update and list all the users and their details.
    We also use spring security for this project to do the login and all. This project can add, save, delete,
    update and list all the users that are saved in mysql. We use bootstrap, html, css and js for the front end part
    of the project.
